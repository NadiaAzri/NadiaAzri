Hey ðŸ‘‹, I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Analytics at Touro University, passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights. My academic journey has fueled my interest in using data-driven approaches to solve real-world challenges, particularly in healthcare. I have worked on breast cancer diagnosis projects, analyzing large datasets to improve decision-making and accuracy.

With a background in computer science, I have developed strong skills in Python, SQL and data visualization. I enjoy exploring patterns in data and translating them into valuable insights.
